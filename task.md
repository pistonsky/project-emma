Congratulations on getting to this stage of our interview process.

This test aims to show us your understanding of React Native development and your craftsmanship when it comes to delivering a small well tested/documented project.

Take your time to finish the test properly (it is not a time race). When we grade a submission, we’re evaluating it like we would a pull request on our codebase; we expect it to be great and we hope you’ll find it interesting and fun!

The challenge is to build a React Native App that replicates the below app.

**Requirements:**

- Please avoid using 3rd-party libraries: we want to see your code and problem solving.
- App content: you can read the list of contacts and their info from a local .json file.
- Make sure your solution works on both iOS and Android.
- We expect you to implement this using modern JavaScript, extra points if you use TypeScript or Flow for type safety. You are allowed to write some native code if you have a need for it.
- Tests are not optional. We don’t expect good test coverage, we just want to see a few tests on the parts of your app where you think tests are most helpful.
- Have a short README file explaining how to start the app and run the test suite.
- You are free to make assumptions if you find anything ambiguous in the above instructions, just make sure to list those in the README or in comments
- Don't be afraid to cut some corners if you are tight on time. The priority should always be on showing off great code, just make sure to explain what feature you didn't have time to implement.

### Bonus tasks:

- Make your app's main component(s) reusable and package them as you would do if you were to distribute it as open source for other developers to use.
- Tapping on a profile picture should navigate to a "detail" view about the tapped contact. You are free to style that view as you like.
